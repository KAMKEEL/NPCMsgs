#       - Do not Edit this File, it is solely for storage of custom created Groups. It is better to manage and   #
#         delete Groups on a server then through here.                                                           #
#         This file will help determine the load order of Groups. They correspond directly with                  #
#         the group.yml's in the groups folder. You can add your group name here if you are                      #
#         importing your file.                                                                                   #

#       - Don't mess with the Groups NAME. This could corrupt your server.                                       #
